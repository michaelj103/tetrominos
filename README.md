# tetrominos

A utility for solving tetromino puzzles like those found in the game The Talos Principle

The goal of the puzzles is to file a rectangulare grid with a set of provided "tetrominos". The solver runs a simple backtracking algorithm to try all possible placement combinations and prints the first solution that it finds.
